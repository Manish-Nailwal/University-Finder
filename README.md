# How-It-Works
Welcome to our college and university search tool! Whether you’re a student, a parent, or just curious, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a brief overview:

Search by State:
=> To find colleges and universities in your state, simply enter the name of your state in the search bar.
=> If you accidentally type an invalid state name, don’t worry! Our system will kindly let you know.
=> Keep in mind that our database doesn’t cover every single educational institution out there, so you might see details for only a subset of colleges.
